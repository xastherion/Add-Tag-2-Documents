# Add-Tag-2-Documents
A very functional work-around for that macOS Problem "Can't tag local Documents folder : Error -8058"

Use:
Be sure you have a Backup from ~/Documents, i recomend easy and fast: "send to zip"

Save this Script anywhere in your Mac, give it "chmod +x addtag.sh" and run with ./addtag.sh
the Script ask you for a Tag in the Folder ~/D. Add the Tag you need, then press any Key.

Now you have a Document folder with your Tag! Enjoy
